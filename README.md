Self-hosted URL-to-Markdown service for humans and AI agents.

</p>

PullMD takes any web URL and returns clean, readable Markdown — no
navigation, no ads, no boilerplate. It auto-detects Reddit and
Hacker News threads (with full comment trees), uses Cloudflare's native Markdown when
available, runs Mozilla Readability + Trafilatura on static HTML,
and as a last resort renders JavaScript-heavy pages via headless
Chromium (Playwright sidecar) before extracting.

As of **v3**, PullMD goes beyond web pages: it also converts documents
(PDF, Office, EPUB), images, audio, and YouTube videos to Markdown, and
emits a leaner, token-efficient body by default. See
[What's new in v3](#whats-new-in-v3) below.

It ships as:

- a **PWA frontend** with raw/rendered and live-frontmatter view toggles, one-tap sharing of the output to other apps (Web Share API), a download button that saves the result as a `.md` file under the server-suggested name, dark/paper themes, history, archive, share links, and conversion of local HTML files (drag-and-drop on desktop, file picker on desktop and mobile)
- a **REST API** at `GET /api?url=…`
- an **MCP server** at `POST /mcp` (Streamable-HTTP transport, stateless)
- a **Claude Code skill** as a downloadable zip

Every conversion gets a 32-hex **share id** that works as a stable
live-endpoint: `GET /s/:id` returns the cached markdown and
re-fetches from the source if older than one hour. Use the share id
as a fixed URL that always returns fresh content — useful for
subreddit feeds and similar.

## What's new in v3

PullMD v3 grows from a web-page reader into a general **anything-to-Markdown**
service for agents, with a leaner default output. Everything beyond plain web
extraction is **opt-in and degrades gracefully** - left unconfigured, v3 handles
web pages exactly like v2, just with a cleaner body by default.

- **Clean body by default** - the Markdown body is now just `# Title` + content. The source URL, fetch date, and all metadata moved into the YAML frontmatter, so nothing is duplicated and you spend fewer tokens. Reddit posts follow the same rule: subreddit, author, upvotes, and publish date live in the frontmatter (`subreddit`, `author`, `upvotes`, `published`), not the body. This is the one breaking change: set `PULLMD_SOURCE_HEADER=true` to restore the old inline header, and use [`PULLMD_FRONTMATTER_FIELDS`](#configuration) to trim which fields are emitted. See [`MIGRATION.md`](./MIGRATION.md).
- **Documents → Markdown** - PDF, Word, PowerPoint, Excel, EPUB and more, [by URL or upload](#document-conversion) (`POST /api/file`, drag-and-drop in the PWA).
- **High-quality PDF tables (OCR)** - an opt-in, vendor-neutral [OCR tier](#high-quality-pdf-ocr) (`?pdf=ocr`) for table-grade PDF conversion, with automatic fallback to the free path.
- **Images & audio → Markdown** - opt-in [captioning and transcription](#media-tier-image-captions--audio-transcription) via any OpenAI-compatible or local model; runs inside pullmd, no extra container required.
- **YouTube transcripts** - [title, description and transcript](#youtube-transcripts) with clickable timecodes, no API key required.
- **Richer frontmatter** - extraction source, quality, and (for media/OCR) [model + token/page usage](#source-specific-frontmatter-fields) for cost tracking, plus a configurable field allowlist.

> Self-hosters upgrading from v2.x: the clean-body change is the only breaking one - [`MIGRATION.md`](./MIGRATION.md) has the one-line opt-out. Everything else is additive.

**Added in the 3.x line since then:**

- **Hacker News pipeline** (3.1) - items, comment permalinks and listings through a purpose-built converter, plus Web Share and an instant frontmatter toggle in the PWA.
- **`X-Transcript-Status`** (3.2) - tells a transient YouTube rate-limit apart from a genuinely missing transcript.
- **[SSRF protection](#ssrf-protection)** (3.3) - private, loopback, link-local, CGNAT and cloud-metadata targets are rejected by default, on every fetch path and every redirect hop.
- **[Query-scoped extraction](#query-scoped-extraction)** (3.4) - `?query=` returns only the sections relevant to a question, with a `max_tokens` budget.
- **[Site recipes opened up](#site-recipes)** (3.5/3.6) - JSON-LD-to-frontmatter, a contributor guide, and `select.content` so a recipe can name the article body outright.
- **Coverage guard** (3.7) - recovers pages where extraction kept only a sliver of the body; see [`PULLMD_COVERAGE_GUARD`](#configuration).
- **Account controls** (3.8) - a non-admin can clear entries from their own history, self-registration can be closed with [`PULLMD_ALLOW_SIGNUP`](#configuration), and `scripts/admin.js create-user` creates accounts from the shell.
- **Download button** (3.9) - the PWA saves a result as a `.md` file, named by the server via [`X-Suggested-Filename`](#response-headers) and optionally date-prefixed.
- **[Sidecar health endpoint](#monitoring)** (3.10) - `GET /api/status` answers `503` when a configured sidecar stops responding, so a dead renderer shows up as an alert instead of quietly degrading extraction.
- **Configurable cache retention** (3.11) - [`PULLMD_CACHE_RETENTION_DAYS`](#configuration) sets how long cache rows and share links live; default 90 days, `0` keeps them forever.

## Quick start

Pre-built multi-arch images (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`) live on Docker
Hub. Drop the compose file somewhere and run:

```bash
mkdir pullmd && cd pullmd
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AeternaLabsHQ/pullmd/main/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
# → http://localhost:3000
```

That's it. No `.env` needed: every variable has a sensible default
and PullMD listens on port `3000`. Add a `.env` next to the compose
file to override anything (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

### `docker-compose.yml` (zero-config, abridged)

```yaml
services:
  pullmd:
    image: aeternalabshq/pullmd:latest
    container_name: pullmd
    restart: unless-stopped

      - MARKITDOWN_URL=http://markitdown:8003/convert
      - CACHE_DB=/data/cache.db

### Behind Traefik

For deployments behind Traefik with TLS, use `docker-compose.traefik.yml`
instead. Same images, but with Traefik labels and the `proxy` external
network. Set `HOST_DOMAIN` in `.env`:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AeternaLabsHQ/pullmd/main/docker-compose.traefik.yml
echo "HOST_DOMAIN=pullmd.example.com" > .env
docker compose -f docker-compose.traefik.yml up -d
```

### Local development (no Docker)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AeternaLabsHQ/pullmd.git
cd pullmd
npm install
npm start             # http://localhost:3000
npm test              # node --test
```

## Configuration

All variables go in `.env` (copy from `.env.example`):

> **v3.0.0 output format change:** the markdown body is clean by default - just `# Title` followed by content. The source URL, fetch date, and all extraction metadata remain in the YAML frontmatter unchanged - the body no longer duplicates them. Set `PULLMD_SOURCE_HEADER=true` to restore the old inline header. Use `PULLMD_FRONTMATTER_FIELDS` to pick which frontmatter fields are emitted (handy for trimming tokens in agent pipelines).

| Variable               | Required | Purpose                                                                                              |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `HOST_DOMAIN`          | Traefik variant only | Public hostname without scheme. Used by Traefik routing and as fallback for `PUBLIC_URL`. Unused by the default compose. |
| `PUBLIC_URL`           | no       | Full public origin embedded in `/help` and the skill zip. Defaults to `https://${HOST_DOMAIN}`.     |
| `TRAFILATURA_URL`      | no       | URL of the Trafilatura sidecar's `/extract` endpoint. Unset → skip Trafilatura, Readability only.    |
| `PLAYWRIGHT_URL`       | no       | URL of the Playwright sidecar's `/render` endpoint. Unset → skip Playwright fallback for JS pages.   |
| `MARKITDOWN_URL`       | no       | URL of the MarkItDown sidecar's `/convert` endpoint. Unset → document-conversion path disabled; `POST /api/file` returns `502`. |
| `PULLMD_VISION_API_KEY` / `…_BASE_URL` / `…_MODEL` | no | Image captioning via an OpenAI-compatible vision endpoint. Enabled when the key is set. `_MODEL` defaults to `gpt-4o-mini`. |
| `PULLMD_STT_API_KEY` / `…_BASE_URL` / `…_MODEL` | no | Audio transcription via an OpenAI-compatible `/audio/transcriptions` endpoint. Enabled when the key is set. `_MODEL` defaults to `whisper-1`. |
| `PULLMD_LLM_API_KEY` / `…_BASE_URL` | no | Shared fallback credentials for vision + STT when the per-modality vars are unset. Key and base URL only - there is no `PULLMD_LLM_MODEL`, and setting one is ignored (the server warns at startup). |
| `PULLMD_PDF_OCR_API_KEY` / `…_BASE_URL` / `…_MODEL` | no | Opt-in high-quality PDF→Markdown via an OCR provider that preserves tables (reference: Mistral OCR `mistral-ocr-latest`). Triggered per request with `?pdf=ocr` or a recipe `fetch.pdf: ocr`. Default PDF handling stays the free markitdown path. `_MODEL` defaults to `mistral-ocr-latest`. |
| `MARKITDOWN_YOUTUBE`   | no       | Set to `true` to route YouTube URLs through the markitdown sidecar (returns title + description + transcript). No API key required. Default: off. |
| `MARKITDOWN_YT_TIMECODES` | no (sidecar) | Default timecode format in transcripts: `links` (YouTube timestamp links, default), `plain` (bare `[MM:SS]` labels), `none` (transcript text only). Overridable per-request via `?yt_timecodes=`. |
| `MARKITDOWN_YT_CHUNK`  | no (sidecar) | Transcript block size in seconds (default `30`). `0` keeps the original per-snippet granularity. Overridable per-request via `?yt_chunk=`. |
| `MARKITDOWN_YT_LANGS`  | no (sidecar) | Comma-separated preferred transcript languages (e.g. `de,en`). Falls back to the first available language if none of the preferred ones exist. |
| `MARKITDOWN_YT_PROXY`  | no (sidecar) | HTTP(S) proxy URL for YouTube requests. Datacenter IP addresses are often rate-limited by YouTube's transcript API; a residential or ISP proxy can help. |
| `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID`     | no       | OAuth credentials for Reddit. Without them, PullMD uses the public JSON API (lower rate limit).     |
| `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET` | no       |                                                                                                      |
| `REDDIT_USER_AGENT`    | no       | Reddit requires a unique UA. Default: `PullMD/1.0 (URL-to-Markdown service)`.                       |
| `DISABLE_PUBLIC_HISTORY` | no     | When `true`, hides the global recent-conversions list and archive (`/api/history` + `/api/archive` return 403, frontend hides the section). `/s/:id` share links keep working. Default: `false`. |
| `PULLMD_USER_AGENT`    | no       | Pin a single outbound User-Agent for every web fetch. Disables rotation. Useful for CI or when one specific UA is known to work. |
| `PULLMD_UA_FEED_URL`   | no       | URL of a JSON feed of current real-world UAs. Default: [WinFuture23/real-world-user-agents](https://github.com/WinFuture23/real-world-user-agents). Set to an empty string to disable live refresh and rely on the built-in seed pool. |
| `PULLMD_AUTH_MODE`     | no       | `disabled` (default) / `single-admin` / `multi-user`. See "Authentication" below.                   |
| `PULLMD_ALLOW_SIGNUP`  | no       | Self-registration in `multi-user` mode. Default: on. `false` / `0` / `no` / `off` closes `/signup` (404) and removes the "create an account" link from the login page. Accounts can still be created with `node scripts/admin.js create-user <email>`. |
| `PULLMD_ADMIN_EMAIL`   | required when AUTH_MODE != disabled, on first startup | Bootstrap email for the first admin user.                            |
| `PULLMD_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | required when AUTH_MODE != disabled, on first startup | Bootstrap password (min 8 chars).                                    |
| `PULLMD_AUTH_TOKEN`    | no       | Legacy bearer token compat (single-admin mode only, deprecated).                                    |
| `PULLMD_SOURCE_HEADER` | no       | Set to `true` to restore the legacy inline source header in the body (`# Title` + `**domain** · date` + url; for Reddit the `**r/sub** · u/user · N ↑` line). Default (unset): clean body - just the H1 title; source/date/post meta live in the frontmatter. |
| `PULLMD_FRONTMATTER_FIELDS` | no  | Comma-separated allowlist of frontmatter fields to emit (e.g. `title,url,source,llm_tokens`). Unset = all fields. Trims tokens. Unknown names are ignored with a startup warning. |
| `PULLMD_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | no | Comma-separated CIDRs and/or exact hostnames that may be fetched even though they resolve into a blocked range. Empty by default = every internal target is blocked. See [SSRF protection](#ssrf-protection). |
| `PULLMD_SITE_RECIPES`  | no       | Path to a JSON file of extra [site recipes](#site-recipes), merged on top of the built-ins. Alternative to `data/site-recipes.json`. |
| `PULLMD_FILENAME_DATE_PREFIX` | no | Prefix template for the suggested download filename (`X-Suggested-Filename`). Unset = no prefix. Tokens `YYYY MM DD HH mm ss` are substituted in local time, all other characters pass through; anything outside `A-Za-z0-9._-` ends up as a hyphen. Example: `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm-ss-` gives `2026-08-01-13-33-42-YT-some-talk-dQw4w9WgXcQ.md`. |
| `PULLMD_CACHE_RETENTION_DAYS` | no | How long cache rows survive without a re-fetch, in days. Default: `90`. `0` = unlimited: nothing is ever pruned, so the cache doubles as an archive. The accepted range is `0` to `36500` (100 years); anything else warns once at startup and falls back to `90`. Share links expire with their row - `/s/:id` stops resolving once the row is older than the retention window. Lowering the value on a running instance prunes every row older than the new value on the next cache write (any conversion). |
| `PULLMD_COVERAGE_GUARD` | no | Set to `off` to disable the coverage guard. Default (unset): on. The guard notices when an extraction kept only a sliver of the page - the failure mode of page-builder one-pagers, whose chapters sit in flat sibling containers that Readability's single-candidate scoring discards - and re-converts the container holding the body instead. It only ever grows the result, records `source: coverage-guard`, and explains itself in `metadata.extractorReason`. |

`PUBLIC_URL` matters for self-hosting: the help page and downloadable
skill embed it as the canonical endpoint. Set it correctly and your
users get a copy-paste setup that points at *your* instance.

PullMD rotates its outbound User-Agent for the web fetch path from a
pool of current desktop browsers, refreshed every 48 hours from a
[live feed of real-world UAs](https://github.com/WinFuture23/real-world-user-agents)
maintained by [@WinFuture23](https://github.com/WinFuture23). A built-in
seed pool ensures rotation works even when the feed is unreachable. Set
`PULLMD_USER_AGENT` to pin a single UA, or `PULLMD_UA_FEED_URL` to point
at your own feed. The Reddit path keeps its dedicated `REDDIT_USER_AGENT`
because Reddit's API expects a stable, identifying UA.

`DISABLE_PUBLIC_HISTORY=true` is the privacy switch for shared
instances (multi-tenant VPS, office deployments). Conversions still
get cached and assigned share IDs; users just can't see what *other*
users have fetched. Anyone with a known `/s/:id` link still gets
their markdown back. Share ids are 128 random bits, so a link cannot
be guessed, and `/s/:id` throttles unknown-id lookups to 120 per
minute and IP (valid links are never throttled). Use this as a
stopgap until per-user scoping lands.

## Authentication (v2.0+)

> **Version pinning:** `:latest` tracks the newest release (v3). v3's only
> breaking change is the [clean-body output format](#whats-new-in-v3) — to
> stay on the v2.x output format instead, pin the explicit major tag:
>
> ```yaml
> services:
>   pullmd:
>     image: aeternalabshq/pullmd:2
> ```

PullMD ships with three auth modes. Pick one with `PULLMD_AUTH_MODE`:

| Mode           | Behavior                                                                    |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `disabled`     | Default. No auth, everything open. Existing v1.x behavior.                  |
| `single-admin` | One user, credentials from env vars. No self-signup. For homelab.           |
| `multi-user`   | Self-signup at `/signup` (unless `PULLMD_ALLOW_SIGNUP` is off), login at `/login`, per-user data isolation. |

In `single-admin` and `multi-user` modes, `PULLMD_ADMIN_EMAIL` + `PULLMD_ADMIN_PASSWORD` bootstrap the first admin user on first startup. After that, changing these env vars does **not** change the password — use the admin CLI:

```bash
docker compose exec pullmd node scripts/admin.js reset-password you@example.com
```

Create an account without opening self-registration (useful when
`PULLMD_ALLOW_SIGNUP` is off):

```bash
docker compose exec pullmd node scripts/admin.js create-user someone@example.com
```

Both commands read the password from stdin, so they need it attached:
`docker compose exec`, `docker exec -it`, or a pipe
(`echo "…" | docker exec -i <container> node scripts/admin.js …`). A plain
`docker exec` without `-i` aborts with an error and exit code 2 instead of
doing nothing.

### Auth boundary

| Endpoint                                                         | Auth required (when mode != disabled) |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | :-----------------------------------: |
| `/`, `/help`, static assets, `/pullmd.zip`                   |                  no                  |
| `/login`, `/signup`, `/api/me` (auth surface)                    |                  no                  |
| `/s/:id` (share links)                                           |                  no                  |
| `/api`, `/api/stream`                                            |                 yes                  |
| `POST /api/html`, `POST /api/file`                               |                 yes                  |
| `/mcp`                                                           |                 yes                  |
| `/api/history`, `/api/archive`                                   |                 yes                  |
| `DELETE /api/cache/:id`, `DELETE /api/cache`                     |                 yes                  |
| `/api/stats`, `/api/storage`, `/api/config` (aggregate)          |                  no                  |
| `/api/status`, `/api/recipes/status` (health)                    |                  no                  |

Cache deletes are scoped to the caller. An admin (and every caller in
`disabled` mode) removes the shared, URL-deduped cache row, which affects
every user's history. A regular user only unlinks the entry from their own
history - the shared row and its `/s/:id` share link keep working. The
response says which happened via `"scope": "user" | "global"`.

### Authentication paths

1. **Session cookies** — `POST /login` sets `pullmd_session` (`HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, `Secure` over HTTPS, 90-day TTL with sliding expiry). The PWA uses this automatically.
2. **API keys** — generate at `/settings`, send via `Authorization: Bearer pmd_<32-char-base62>`. Stored as SHA-256 hashes; only shown once at creation.
3. **Legacy `PULLMD_AUTH_TOKEN`** — deprecated. `single-admin` mode only. Maps to admin user. Kept for migration compatibility; slated for removal in a future major release.

### Migration from v1.x

See `MIGRATION.md` for the full upgrade checklist. The TL;DR: leave `PULLMD_AUTH_MODE` unset and v2.0 behaves exactly like v1.x.

### OAuth 2.1 (claude.ai Web Connector)

PullMD ships with a full OAuth 2.1 Authorization Code flow so the **claude.ai
web app's Custom Connector** feature can authenticate users against your
PullMD instance. All endpoints needed by the spec are implemented: Dynamic
Client Registration (RFC 7591), PKCE-S256 (RFC 7636), Authorization Server
Metadata (RFC 8414), Protected Resource Metadata (RFC 9728), and Token
Revocation (RFC 7009).

**Setup:**

1. Set `PULLMD_AUTH_MODE` to `single-admin` or `multi-user` (OAuth requires Phase-1 auth).
2. Set `OAUTH_JWT_SECRET` to a 32+ character random string (`openssl rand -hex 32`).
3. Set `PUBLIC_URL` to your instance's public origin (e.g. `https://pullmd.example.com`).
4. In claude.ai → Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector, point it at `https://pullmd.example.com/mcp` — claude.ai discovers everything else automatically via the well-known endpoints.
5. The first time the user clicks the connector, they'll be redirected to PullMD's `/login`, then to a consent screen, then back to claude.ai.

**Tokens:**
- Access tokens are JWTs (HS256), TTL 1 hour, audience-bound to your `/mcp` URL.
- Refresh tokens are opaque (`pmd_rt_…`), TTL 30 days, rotated on every refresh, with reuse-detection that invalidates the entire refresh chain on replay.
- Revoke a token via `POST /oauth/revoke` (RFC 7009).

**Scope:** Currently a single `mcp:full` scope (URL conversion + history read). Granular scopes are tracked for a future minor release.

Shipped in v2.3.0 (issues [#6](https://github.com/AeternaLabsHQ/pullmd/issues/6) and [#10](https://github.com/AeternaLabsHQ/pullmd/issues/10)).

## AI-agent integration

Three install paths. Once your instance is running, `${PULLMD_URL}/help`
shows the same boxes with your URL pre-filled. Replace `${PULLMD_URL}`
below with your hostname (e.g. `https://pullmd.example.com`).

### 1. Universal prompt

Drop into any chat agent (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, …):

```
When you need to read a web page, fetch it via PullMD instead of your
built-in fetch/browse tool - not just when that one fails:

  GET ${PULLMD_URL}/api?url=<URL>

Returns clean Markdown (text/markdown). Optional query params:

  comments=false        skip Reddit comments
  comment_depth=N       comment nesting depth (default 3)
  frontmatter=true      prepend YAML metadata block
  format=text           strip Markdown, return plain text
  nocache=true          bypass the 1h cache and refetch
  render=force|skip     override the auto Playwright fallback
  pdf=ocr               high-quality PDF conversion (tables)
  query=<text>          got a specific question? pass it and get back only
                        the matching sections (70-95% fewer tokens)
  max_tokens=N          budget for query= (default 600, 64-20000)
  lang=de|en            language for the comments section header

Response headers worth checking:
  X-Source       reddit | hackernews | cloudflare | readability | trafilatura |
                 playwright | markitdown | youtube | pdf-ocr | ...
  X-Quality      0.0-1.0 extraction confidence
  X-Share-Id     32-hex permalink, openable as /s/<id>
  X-Transcript-Status  youtube only: ok | none | blocked | error
                 (blocked/error = transient, not cached — retry later)

Reddit URLs are auto-detected (incl. redd.it short links and /s/ shares).
Hacker News URLs are auto-detected too — items, comment permalinks, and the
front/newest/ask/show/jobs listings.
Use this whenever you would otherwise fetch raw HTML — the markdown is
much cleaner and saves significant context window space. When you only
need specific information rather than the whole document, pass your
question as query= and get back just the relevant sections.
```

### 2. Claude Code skill

`pullmd.zip` is auto-built with your URL embedded:

```bash
curl -O ${PULLMD_URL}/pullmd.zip
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
unzip pullmd.zip -d ~/.claude/skills/
# Restart Claude Code; the skill activates on web-reading requests.
```

> **Upgrading from pre-v3?** The skill was renamed from `web-reader` to
> `pullmd` in v3.0.0. Installing the new zip does **not** replace an
> existing install — remove the old one first, or both skills will be
> active side by side:
>
> ```bash
> rm -rf ~/.claude/skills/web-reader
> ```
>
> (The old download URL `/web-reader.zip` keeps working as a redirect.)

### 3. MCP server

Remote MCP server at `${PULLMD_URL}/mcp` (Streamable-HTTP transport, stateless).
Three tools: `read_url`, `get_share`, `list_recent`. Server-side updates reach
every client automatically — no local install needed.

**Claude Code (CLI):**

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http pullmd ${PULLMD_URL}/mcp
```

**Claude Desktop / Cursor / other MCP hosts — JSON config:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pullmd": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "${PULLMD_URL}/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Once registered, the three tools surface natively in the agent — no prompt
instructions needed, the LLM picks them up via their schema descriptions.

### MCP client compatibility

| Client          | Bearer (`Authorization: Bearer pmd_...`) | OAuth (v2.3+) | Notes                                  |
| --------------- | :--------------------------------------: | :-----------: | -------------------------------------- |
| Claude Code CLI |                    ✅                    |       ✅      | Recommended. Generate a key at `/settings`. |
| Cursor          |                    ✅                    |       ✅      | Same as CLI.                           |
| Claude Desktop  |                    ❌                    |       ✅      | Connector UI lacks a header field — use [OAuth](#oauth-21-claudeai-web-connector). |
| claude.ai (web) |                    ❌                    |       ✅      | Requires [OAuth](#oauth-21-claudeai-web-connector). |

OAuth shipped in v2.3.0 — enable it via `OAUTH_JWT_SECRET` (see above) and
Claude Desktop / claude.ai connect natively. The reverse-proxy workaround
below is only needed on instances that keep OAuth disabled.

#### Claude Desktop limitation (without OAuth)

The Claude Desktop "Add custom connector" UI accepts URL + OAuth
Client ID/Secret but no custom-header field. Additionally,
`claude_desktop_config.json` entries with `"type": "http"` are silently
rewritten to `{}` after Desktop launches (current Desktop only honors
stdio servers in that file).

If OAuth is not enabled on your instance, the practical workaround for
Claude Desktop users is a reverse proxy that accepts the auth token as
either a bearer header (for CLI) or as a URL path prefix (for Desktop,
which has no header field).

#### Caddy workaround for Claude Desktop

Contributed by [@WinFuture23](https://github.com/AeternaLabsHQ/pullmd/issues/10):

```caddy
@bearer header Authorization "Bearer {$AUTH_TOKEN}"
handle @bearer { reverse_proxy pullmd:3000 }

@token_path path /{$AUTH_TOKEN}/* /{$AUTH_TOKEN}
handle @token_path {
    uri strip_prefix /{$AUTH_TOKEN}
    reverse_proxy pullmd:3000
}
```

Then in Claude Desktop's connector dialog, use the URL with the token
path prefix: `https://your-instance.com/<TOKEN>/mcp`. CLI clients keep
using the `Authorization` header as normal.

This is a stopgap pattern; enabling the built-in OAuth removes the need
for it.

## API

| Endpoint               | Returns                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /api?url=…`       | Markdown (or JSON / plain text via `format=`). Also handles direct links to documents (PDF, Office, EPUB, …) when the markitdown sidecar is configured. |
| `GET /api/stream?url=…`| Server-Sent Events stream of extraction-stage status, ending in a `result` event. Used by the PWA. |
| `POST /api/html`       | Convert a local/raw HTML document (body = HTML, max 10 MB). Never cached — no history entry, no share link. |
| `POST /api/file`       | Convert an uploaded document (raw file bytes in body; set `Content-Type` to the file's MIME type; filename via `X-Filename` header or `?filename=`; max 25 MB). Returns Markdown. Requires the markitdown sidecar (`MARKITDOWN_URL`) for document types (PDF, Office, EPUB, ...); image and audio uploads instead use the `PULLMD_VISION_*` / `PULLMD_STT_*` tier (no markitdown container needed). |
| `GET /s/:id`           | Cached Markdown by share id; refreshes from source if > 1 h old.                 |
| `GET /api/history`     | Recent conversions (JSON).                                                       |
| `GET /api/archive`     | Paginated full archive.                                                          |
| `GET /api/storage`     | Cache size / hit-rate stats.                                                     |
| `GET /api/stats`       | Extraction telemetry (sources, quality, latency). `?window=-7 days`.             |
| `GET /api/config`      | Which optional tiers this instance has enabled (auth mode, markitdown, vision, STT, PDF OCR, YouTube). The PWA reads it to show or hide controls. |
| `GET /api/recipes/status` | Which [site recipes](#site-recipes) loaded, which were rejected, and any frontmatter fields dropped by the allowlist. |
| `GET /api/status`      | Health of the extraction sidecars (trafilatura, Playwright, markitdown). `200` when every configured sidecar answers, `503` when one is down. See [Monitoring](#monitoring). |
| `POST /mcp`            | Streamable-HTTP MCP endpoint (3 tools: `read_url`, `get_share`, `list_recent`). |
| `GET /pullmd.zip`      | Claude Code skill bundle, with this instance's URL baked in (`/web-reader.zip` redirects here). |
| `GET /help`            | Bilingual user/agent setup guide.                                                |

### `/api` parameters

| Param           | Default | Notes                                                                              |
| --------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `url`           | —       | Required.                                                                          |
| `comments`      | `true`  | Include Reddit / Hacker News comments. Ignored for other URLs.                     |
| `comment_depth` | `3`     | Max nesting depth (1–10). Applies to Reddit and Hacker News.                       |
| `comment_limit` | none    | Max top-level comments (uncapped by default).                                      |
| `frontmatter`   | `false` | Prepend YAML metadata.                                                             |
| `format`        | `md`    | `text` strips Markdown; `json` returns structured response.                        |
| `nocache`       | `false` | Bypass the 1-hour cache.                                                           |
| `render`        | auto    | `force` → always render via Playwright. `skip` → never render. Bypasses cache.     |
| `extractor`     | auto    | Force `readability` / `trafilatura` / `playwright` and skip the quality pick. Bypasses cache. |
| `pdf`           | —       | `ocr` → route PDFs through the [OCR tier](#high-quality-pdf-ocr). Bypasses cache.  |
| `yt_timecodes` / `yt_chunk` | see [YouTube](#youtube-transcripts) | Transcript format overrides. Bypass cache when set. |
| `lang`          | `de`    | Comments-section header language (`de` or `en`).                                   |
| `query`         | —       | Set this when you need specific information from a page rather than the whole document: pass the question, get back only the matching sections (see [Query-scoped extraction](#query-scoped-extraction)). Empty/whitespace-only is treated as absent — output is unchanged. |
| `max_tokens`    | `600`   | Token budget for `query` extraction (`64`–`20000`). No effect without `query`; raise it when the answer likely spans several sections. Only validated when `query` is non-empty; an invalid value returns `400`. |

Both `query` and `max_tokens` are also available on the MCP `read_url` tool.

### Response headers

- `X-Source` — `reddit` · `cloudflare` · `readability` · `readability-fallback` · `trafilatura` · `playwright` · `recipe-content` · `coverage-guard` · `markitdown` · `youtube` · `image-caption` · `audio-transcript` · `pdf-ocr`
- `X-Quality` — `0.0`–`1.0` extraction confidence
- `X-Share-Id` — the 32-hex permalink id
- `X-Suggested-Filename` — a download filename for this conversion, e.g. `YT-some-talk-dQw4w9WgXcQ.md`. YouTube gets title plus video id, images/audio/documents keep the original file name from the URL, everything else uses the title; `PULLMD_FILENAME_DATE_PREFIX` prepends a date. Also on `/s/:id`, `POST /api/html` and `POST /api/file`; on `/api/stream` the same value arrives as `suggestedFilename` in the `result` event, since SSE has no headers to carry it.
- `X-Transcript-Status` — YouTube only: `ok` · `none` · `blocked` · `error`. `blocked` (YouTube rate-limited the transcript fetch, HTTP 429) and `error` are transient and not cached — retry later; `none` means the video genuinely has no transcript
- `X-Extracted` — `true` / `false`. Present only when `query` is active.
- `X-Extract-Confidence` — `high` · `medium` · `low`. Present whenever `X-Extracted` is present, except when the page was already small enough that extraction was skipped.
- `X-Extract-Sections` — number of sections/regions included in the returned markdown.
- `X-Extract-Original-Tokens` / `X-Extract-Returned-Tokens` — estimated token counts (`chars / 4`) of the full page and of the returned markdown.

### Query-scoped extraction

When you have a specific question about a long page, you rarely need the whole
document. Pass the question as `?query=<text>` on `GET /api` (or the `query`
param on the MCP `read_url` tool) to get back only the sections relevant to it
instead of the full Markdown body - typically 70-95% fewer tokens on long
pages:

```
GET /api?url=https://example.com/long-article&query=how+does+caching+work
```

It's a BM25 ranking over the page's heading-based sections (falling back to
paragraph-level blocks for pages with fewer than two headings) — no network
calls, no LLM involved.

- **Budget** — `max_tokens` caps the returned size (default `600`, range
  `64`–`20000`, estimated as `chars / 4`).
- **Whole-page fallback** — the full page is returned unchanged when either
  the page is already small enough that extraction wouldn't help (estimated
  tokens ≤ `max(800, 1.25 × max_tokens)`), or nothing in the page scores
  against the query's terms. In both cases `extracted` is `false`; the
  no-match case reports `confidence: low`, the small-page case omits
  `confidence`.
- **Atomic blocks** — code fences, tables, lists, and blockquotes are never
  split; if any part of one is relevant, the whole block is kept.
  Non-contiguous output regions are joined by an elision marker (`<!-- … -->`).
- `?frontmatter=true` adds `extracted`, `extract_confidence`,
  `sections_selected`, `original_tokens`, `returned_tokens` to the YAML block.
  `format=json` adds a top-level `extract` object with the same data
  (`extracted`, `confidence`, `sectionsSelected`, `originalTokens`,
  `returnedTokens`).
- Extraction runs on the already-cached full page — the cache always stores
  the complete Markdown, so several different `query` values against the same
  URL cost one fetch (within the normal 1-hour cache TTL), not one per query.
- Omitting `query` (or passing an empty/whitespace-only string) leaves `/api`
  behavior completely unchanged — no extra headers, no extra JSON or
  frontmatter fields.
- MCP `read_url` has no response headers; when nothing matches, it prepends an
  in-band comment (`<!-- query-extract: no match; returning full page -->`) to
  the returned markdown instead.

## SSRF protection

A URL-fetching service will happily be pointed at its own network if you let
it. Since v3.3.0 PullMD does not: before any fetch, the target host is
resolved and the resulting addresses are checked. Anything in a private,
loopback, link-local, CGNAT or cloud-metadata range is refused with `403` —
including `169.254.169.254` (AWS/GCP/Azure) and `100.100.100.200` (Alibaba).

- `GET /api` and the MCP `read_url` tool check the URL up front and answer
  `403` before doing any work. `GET /api/stream` is covered by the same guard
  one layer down, in the Reddit / web / Playwright fetch paths, and surfaces
  the refusal as an SSE `error` event.
- **Every redirect hop is re-checked** before it is followed, so a public URL
  that redirects inward is blocked at the hop, not after it.
- IPv6 is covered too, including blocked v4 ranges reached through transition
  addressing (IPv4-mapped, NAT64, 6to4, IPv4-compatible).
- The rejection happens before the cache is touched — a blocked URL never
  produces a cache row or a share id.

To reach an internal host on purpose (an intranet wiki, a document server on
the same network), allowlist it:

```bash
# CIDRs, exact hostnames, or both
PULLMD_ALLOWED_HOSTS=10.0.5.0/24,wiki.internal
```

Empty (the default) means every internal target stays blocked.

> **Known residual:** the guard checks resolved IPs at request time but does
> not pin the outbound socket to the address it checked, so a DNS-rebinding
> attack (where the name resolves differently between check and connect) is
> not fully closed. When PullMD runs behind an outbound HTTP proxy, the proxy
> resolves names itself — its egress filtering, not this guard, is the
> authoritative layer for traffic it forwards.

Reported as [#41](https://github.com/AeternaLabsHQ/pullmd/issues/41), shipped in v3.3.0.

## Cache & TTLs

- **`/api?url=…`** re-fetches from source if the cache row is older than **1 hour**.
- **`/s/:id`** does the same on-demand refresh, so share links double as live endpoints.
- Cache rows are pruned `PULLMD_CACHE_RETENTION_DAYS` days (default **90**; `0` keeps them forever) after the last write. `/s/:id` hits keep the row alive (since they trigger refresh + write); read-only access does not extend the TTL.
- If the source is unreachable on refresh, the last good snapshot is served — share links keep working even when the original URL dies.

---

## Monitoring

`GET /api/status` reports whether the extraction sidecars are reachable:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "version": "3.9.0",
  "services": {
    "trafilatura": { "status": "ok", "latencyMs": 3 },
    "playwright":  { "status": "down", "error": "unreachable" },
    "markitdown":  { "status": "not-configured" }
  }
}
```

- `status` is `ok`, `down`, or `not-configured`. A sidecar you never configured is not a failure — self-hosting without Playwright or markitdown is a supported setup.
- `error` is one of `unreachable`, `timeout`, `unhealthy` (answered `200` but reports itself broken), `http <code>`, or `misconfigured`. Deliberately a closed vocabulary: the endpoint is public and must not echo internal hostnames.
- HTTP **`200`** when every configured sidecar answers, **`503`** when at least one is down, so a plain HTTP check catches it without keyword matching.
- Results are cached for 5 seconds and concurrent callers share one round of probes, so polling it cannot amplify into internal traffic.

Why it exists: a broken sidecar does not take PullMD down, it silently degrades extraction quality — pages that need a browser render come back near-empty while everything still answers `200`. Without an explicit check that can go unnoticed for a long time.

**Uptime Kuma:** monitor type *HTTP(s)*, URL `https://<your-host>/api/status`, accepted status codes `200-299`. On an instance with authentication enabled the endpoint stays reachable without credentials.

---

## Document conversion

When the markitdown sidecar is running (set `MARKITDOWN_URL=http://markitdown:8003/convert`), PullMD can convert document files to Markdown in addition to web pages.

**Supported formats:** PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX/XLS, EPUB, ZIP (contents listed), CSV, JSON, XML.

**Two ways to convert documents:**

- **By URL** — pass a direct document link to the regular API:
  ```
  GET /api?url=https://example.com/report.pdf
  ```
  PullMD detects the document content type and routes it through the sidecar automatically.

- **By upload** — POST the raw file bytes as the request body (max 25 MB):
  ```
  POST /api/file
  Content-Type: application/pdf        # the file's MIME type
  X-Filename: report.pdf               # URI-encoded; or use ?filename=
  # body: raw file bytes
  ```
  The PWA supports both drag-and-drop and a file picker (desktop and mobile) for the same path.

If `MARKITDOWN_URL` is unset, document conversion is unavailable: a document URL (`GET /api?url=…`) and `POST /api/file` both return `502`. Regular HTML pages are unaffected, and the PWA hides the document-upload affordance (it reads the `markitdown` flag from `/api/config`).

The default `docker-compose.yml` includes the `markitdown` sidecar with `MARKITDOWN_URL` pre-wired. To opt out, remove the `markitdown` service block and unset the env var.

### Media tier (image captions + audio transcription)

Image captioning and audio transcription run inside pullmd itself - the markitdown sidecar is **not** required for media features (it is only needed for document conversion). By default pullmd processes images with EXIF metadata only and audio files with track metadata only - no model calls, no external traffic. Set the relevant `PULLMD_VISION_*` or `PULLMD_STT_*` credentials to unlock richer extraction:

- **Images** - a vision-capable model generates a text caption for each image, embedded in the Markdown output. Enabled when `PULLMD_VISION_API_KEY` (or the shared fallback `PULLMD_LLM_API_KEY`) is set.
- **Audio** - a speech-to-text model transcribes the audio; the transcript replaces the bare metadata block. Enabled when `PULLMD_STT_API_KEY` (or the shared fallback `PULLMD_LLM_API_KEY`) is set.

Both modalities are independently configurable via `PULLMD_*` env vars on the pullmd service:

| Scope | Variables |
| ----- | --------- |
| Vision | `PULLMD_VISION_API_KEY`, `PULLMD_VISION_BASE_URL`, `PULLMD_VISION_MODEL` (default `gpt-4o-mini`) |
| STT | `PULLMD_STT_API_KEY`, `PULLMD_STT_BASE_URL`, `PULLMD_STT_MODEL` (default `whisper-1`) |
| Shared fallback | `PULLMD_LLM_API_KEY`, `PULLMD_LLM_BASE_URL` (used when per-modality key is unset) |

Per-modality vars override the shared `LLM_*` fallback when set. The fallback deliberately stops at the key and the base URL: a single model name cannot serve captioning, transcription and OCR, so `PULLMD_LLM_MODEL` does not exist. Set `PULLMD_VISION_MODEL` / `PULLMD_STT_MODEL` / `PULLMD_PDF_OCR_MODEL` instead - if a `PULLMD_LLM_MODEL` is set anyway, the server says so at startup and the modalities stay on their defaults. Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint works - point `*_BASE_URL` at a local server (e.g. Ollama, LM Studio) to keep everything on-host and avoid per-call cloud costs.

> **Note:** cloud endpoints send image and audio content to a third-party API. Use a local model server if data-residency matters.

### YouTube transcripts

When `MARKITDOWN_YOUTUBE=true` is set on the **pullmd** service, YouTube video URLs are routed through the markitdown sidecar instead of the regular web-extraction pipeline. The sidecar fetches the video's title, description, and auto-generated or community transcript, and returns them as clean Markdown. No API key is required.

```
GET /api?url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
```

The transcript format is configurable via environment defaults on the sidecar, and can also be overridden per request:

| Query param     | Values                      | Default  | Effect                                                           |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `?yt_timecodes` | `links` / `plain` / `none`  | `links`  | `links` = clickable YouTube timestamp URLs; `plain` = `[MM:SS]` labels; `none` = transcript text only |
| `?yt_chunk`     | integer seconds             | `30`     | Groups transcript snippets into blocks of this many seconds. `0` keeps the original per-snippet granularity. |

Both params are also available on the MCP `read_url` tool.

**Language preference:** set `MARKITDOWN_YT_LANGS=de,en` on the sidecar to prefer German transcripts, falling back to English if no German track exists. If none of the preferred languages are available, the sidecar falls back to the first available track.

**Rate-limit caveat:** YouTube's transcript API aggressively rate-limits requests from datacenter IP ranges. If you run PullMD on a cloud VPS and see frequent failures, set `MARKITDOWN_YT_PROXY` on the sidecar to route requests through a residential or ISP proxy.

> **Note:** YouTube extraction requires the markitdown sidecar (`MARKITDOWN_URL`) to be configured. If `MARKITDOWN_URL` is unset, YouTube URLs are processed by the regular web pipeline (HTML extraction via Readability/Trafilatura), which does not include a transcript.

### High-quality PDF (OCR)

By default, PullMD converts PDFs through the free markitdown path, which works well for text-heavy files but loses complex tables. For table-grade output, enable the opt-in OCR tier:

1. Set `PULLMD_PDF_OCR_API_KEY` to your OCR provider key (reference provider: Mistral OCR, ~$0.002/page).
2. Request `?pdf=ocr` on any PDF URL (also on `/api/stream` and `POST /api/file` uploads), or set `fetch.pdf: ocr` as a recipe default.

`PULLMD_PDF_OCR_API_KEY` (and optionally `PULLMD_PDF_OCR_BASE_URL`) must be set explicitly - unlike vision and STT, PDF-OCR does NOT fall back to the shared `PULLMD_LLM_*` key, because the OCR endpoint is typically a different provider (Mistral OCR vs. a chat LLM).

On success, `source` becomes `pdf-ocr` and the frontmatter gains a `pdf_pages` field with the page count. If the OCR call fails or no key is configured, pullmd falls back to the standard markitdown conversion automatically - no error is returned to the caller.

> **Note:** the OCR provider charges per page. Check your provider's pricing before enabling this on high-volume instances.

**Self-hosted / heavy local engines (advanced)**

`PULLMD_PDF_OCR_BASE_URL` can point at any compatible endpoint. Operators who want fully local OCR can run an engine such as [Docling](https://github.com/DS4SD/docling) themselves and set `_BASE_URL` to its address. Be aware that such engines are heavy - a multi-GB container image, and model cold-start times of tens of seconds on first request are typical. This is deliberate: pullmd does not bundle any heavy OCR engine. The reference Mistral OCR path uses a lightweight cloud API call; self-hosting a heavy local engine is an advanced operator choice.

### Source-specific frontmatter fields

When you request `?frontmatter=true`, Reddit, media, and YouTube results include extra fields in the YAML block - post metadata for Reddit, usage fields that let agents compute cost or log telemetry for media. These fields appear **only in the frontmatter** and are never inserted into the body — without `?frontmatter=true` the body is pure content.

| Field | Present when | Description |
| ----- | ------------ | ----------- |
| `subreddit` | Reddit post | Subreddit, e.g. `r/selfhosted`. |
| `author` | Reddit post (also web pages with author metadata) | Post author, e.g. `u/someone`. |
| `published` | Reddit post (also web pages with publish date) | Post creation date (ISO 8601). |
| `upvotes` | Reddit post | Score at time of extraction. |
| `duration` | YouTube | Video duration (humanized, e.g. `12:34` or `H:MM:SS`). |
| `views` | YouTube | View count at time of extraction. |
| `image_size` | Image with caption | Dimensions of the source image: `WxH` pixels. |
| `audio_seconds` | Audio transcription | Length of the audio file in seconds. |
| `llm_model` | Caption or transcription | Model name returned by the upstream API (e.g. `gpt-4o`, `whisper-1`). |
| `llm_tokens` | Caption or transcription | Total tokens consumed (prompt + completion). |
| `llm_prompt_tokens` | Vision caption | Prompt token count (vision calls only). |
| `llm_completion_tokens` | Vision caption | Completion token count (vision calls only). |
| `pdf_pages` | PDF with OCR (`source: pdf-ocr`) | Number of pages processed by the OCR provider. |

A few things worth noting:

- PullMD reports **no computed cost**. Token counts and the model name are what pullmd receives from the upstream API; multiply by the model's per-token rate on your end.
- Image captioning and audio transcription are direct API calls made by pullmd.
- Frontmatter fields for ordinary web pages (`title`, `url`, `source`, `quality`, …) are always present when `?frontmatter=true`; the LLM fields above are additive.

## Site recipes

Site recipes are small declarative JSON entries that adjust extraction for specific hosts — force a browser render, strip site-specific noise, unwrap wrappers that confuse the reader, or promote structured data (JSON-LD / CSS selectors) into the frontmatter. The built-ins ship in [`site-recipes.default.json`](./site-recipes.default.json); self-hosters can add their own via `data/site-recipes.json` or the `PULLMD_SITE_RECIPES` env var (see [`.env.example`](./.env.example)). `GET /api/recipes/status` reports what loaded.

To write or contribute a recipe, see the **[site-recipe contributor guide](./SITE-RECIPES.md)**.

## Architecture

- `server.js` — Express app factory (`createApp`) with dependency injection for tests. Exposes `/api` and `/api/stream` (SSE).
- `lib/reddit.js` — Reddit URL normalization, redirect resolution, post + comment extraction.
- `lib/web.js` — Orchestrator: Cloudflare-Markdown short-circuit, then static Readability + Trafilatura with `pickBest`, then optional Playwright re-render + re-extract on body-soup / low-quality output.
- `lib/render-decision.js` — Predicate that decides when to fall back to Playwright (readability-fellback + thin, body-soup signature, or quality < 0.5; plus `force` / `skip` overrides).
- `lib/playwright-client.js` — HTTP client for the Playwright sidecar with `AbortSignal` propagation for SSE-disconnect cancellation.
- `lib/scoring.js` — Quality scoring used to pick between extractors and as a render-trigger heuristic.
- `lib/cache.js` — SQLite cache (`better-sqlite3`) with configurable retention (default 90 days) and 32-hex (128-bit) share ids.
- `lib/mcp.js` — Stateless MCP server registering the three tools.
- `lib/distrib.js` — Public-URL substitution in `/help` and `/pullmd.zip`.
- `trafilatura-sidecar/` — Python sidecar (FastAPI) wrapping Trafilatura.
- `playwright-sidecar/` — Python sidecar (FastAPI + Playwright + Chromium) for JS-rendered pages.
- `markitdown-sidecar/` — Python sidecar (FastAPI) wrapping MarkItDown for document conversion (PDF, Office, EPUB, …) plus the keyless `/youtube` transcript endpoint.
- `lib/markitdown-client.js` — HTTP client for the markitdown sidecar (documents + YouTube).
- `lib/youtube.js` — YouTube URL detection and normalization.
- `lib/llm/` — provider resolver + adapters for image captioning (vision), audio transcription (STT), and PDF OCR against OpenAI-compatible endpoints.
- `lib/frontmatter.js` — YAML frontmatter builder with the `PULLMD_FRONTMATTER_FIELDS` allowlist.
- `lib/coverage-guard.js` — detects extractions that kept only a sliver of the page and recovers the container holding the body.
- `lib/query-extract.js` — Opt-in query-scoped extraction (`?query=`): BM25 over heading-based sections of the converted markdown, returning only the relevant sections/blocks. Composes `lib/markdown-sections.js` (block/section parser) and `lib/bm25.js` (tokenizer + scorer).
- `public/` — PWA frontend (vanilla JS, dark/paper themes, service worker, EventSource client for `/api/stream`).
- `skill/pullmd/` — Claude Code skill source (templated with `__PULLMD_URL__`).
